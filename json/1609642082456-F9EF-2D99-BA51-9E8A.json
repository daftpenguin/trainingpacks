I have made a short tutorial in the video which explains how to perform wave dashes.Go for powershots when you wave dash just behind the ball that way you have momentum to strike the ball. Another thing you can try is catching the ball by wave dashing underneath the ball. Have fun!","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlwFlaWpEOY","tags":["Shots","Offense","All-Star","Striker","Champion"],"uploadID":104}
