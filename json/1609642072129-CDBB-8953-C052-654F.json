  "notes": "Odd numbered shots (1,3,5...) you are receiving a pass from a teammates. Each even numbered shot (2,4,6...) you are giving the pass you received in the previous shot. For example, In shot 1 you are receiving a pass from your teammates clear, therefore in shot 2 you should try to give the pass that you received in shot 1. A lot of these passes start from a dribble, these are more difficult because you have to control the ball before making a pass rather than slamming it ",
