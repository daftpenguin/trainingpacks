This often prevents the ball from bouncing in an undesirable direction or off the ceiling.\"The timing of these types of clears are much more precise than regular powerclears that involve flipping into the ball but still requires you to hit the ball with the front bumper right after it bounces off the wall.\n\nOnce you become consistent with these clears you can try aiming the direction where you want the ball to travel by hitting different sides of the ball. Have fun!\"","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzYZ0k4aJWc","tags":["Clears","Goalie","Diamond","All-Star"],"uploadID":114}
