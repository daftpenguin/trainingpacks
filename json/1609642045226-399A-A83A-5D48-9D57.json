I have added several side wall and corner wall bounces to mix things up.Make sure you fast aerial towards the ball and try to get a light touch with your front bumper so you get the most power and accuracy. Have fun!","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8rtY06kDr0","tags":["Angle Shots","All-Star","Striker","Champion"],"uploadID":85}
