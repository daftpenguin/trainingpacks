Try to approach the ball at a slight angle, single jump and air roll your car before flipping into the ball. Don't worry if you have difficulty with these shots at first since they require a fair bit of mechanical skill. But once you get the hang of these, you will be able to take shots that are nearly unsavable at close range.Experiment with air roll shots over 180Â° (which is when your car is upside down) and you will be amazed at how much power you can generate from a well timed shot. I have gotten air roll shots over 120 km/h with the flatter cars such as the breakout and the batmobile since I have found that you can get more power with the flatter hitboxes. Try this pack with a bunch of different cars and see what feels best for you, have fun!","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0PNzAdtFX0","tags":["Angle Shots","All-Star","Striker","Platinum"],"uploadID":190}
