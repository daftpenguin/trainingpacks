Most shots are relatively low speed so you have time to think about how your car should hit the ball. I like to jump earlier to get a nice fluid-looking air roll while lining up my hood with the ball. It's great for aerial control and for calculating potentially tight angles.","youtube":"https://youtu.be/_ErevJt_UYA","tags":["Pro","Aerials","Striker","Platinum"],"uploadID":166}
