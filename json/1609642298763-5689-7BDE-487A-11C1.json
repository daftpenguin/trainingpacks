I have created a variety of slow and fast paced bounces that will test your ability to react to different situations.In the first minute of the video I have added instructions on how to perform moves such as the fast aerial, sideways aerial, kuxir twist etc. Chain these moves together to perform a sick freestyle! Have fun!","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoAuW6I_wLs","tags":["Aerials","Shots","Platinum","Freestyles","All-Star","Striker"],"uploadID":178}
