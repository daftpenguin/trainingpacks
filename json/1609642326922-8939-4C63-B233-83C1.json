The last 10 are a mixture of shots and saves that simulate post kickoff situations e.g. Ball bounces off side wall from mid field position.Since kickoffs happen frequently during a match (especially in 1v1), I believe it is important to regularly watch replays of your games and analyse your own kickoffs as well as others. Try to find which kickoff methods work best for you and master it! Have fun!","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tPNcuT_wEk","tags":["Shots","Bounces","Platinum","Kickoffs","All-Star","Striker"],"uploadID":191}
