If you hit the ball back towards the same direction it came then you will likely kill the speed of the ball, which often leads to the opponent scoring. 4, Also make sure not to hit the ball directly into the ceiling as this will often end in a bad result during a real game. 5, Use this training pack to create good habits as a goalie and remember to have fun!","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7wGwtsVfV0","tags":["Saves","Gold","Defense","Clears","Goalie","All-Star"],"uploadID":149}
